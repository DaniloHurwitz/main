        <h1>How I Started in Freelancing: From Zero to $1,000/Month While Studying Medicine</h1>
    </header>
    <article>
        <p>Starting as a freelancer can feel overwhelming, especially when you’re balancing a full-time university schedule. Back in May 2023, I found myself wanting to make money while studying medicine. I knew I couldn’t dedicate full days to a job, but I still wanted to earn something meaningful without compromising my studies.</p>

        <h2>Finding My Niche</h2>
        <p>The first step was identifying what I could offer. I realized that I had skills in <strong>translation, proofreading, and video editing</strong>, all in multiple languages—Hebrew, English, and Spanish. I started small, offering my services at very <strong>low rates</strong> just to build credibility and get my first clients. At first, I was nervous and unsure if anyone would hire me, but I quickly learned that starting with a reasonable price is better than waiting for the “perfect” opportunity.</p>

        <h2>Lessons Learned Early On</h2>
        <p>Once I got my first few projects, I realized two things:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Niche matters.</strong> I focused on technical translations, proofreading for websites, and editing professional videos. By specializing, I could stand out among general freelancers.</li>
            <li><strong>Reputation is everything.</strong> Even small jobs completed perfectly led to <strong>5-star reviews</strong>, which immediately attracted more clients willing to pay higher rates.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Growing My Freelance Income</h2>
        <p>Over time, I began <strong>raising my rates gradually</strong>, matching the quality and experience I was gaining. By working smart—taking projects I could handle efficiently—I reached a point where I was earning <strong>over $1,000 per month</strong>, all while studying medicine full-time.</p>

        <h2>Practical Tips for Beginners</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Start with what you know.</strong> Even if it’s simple, offering a clear, valuable service helps you get your first clients.</li>
            <li><strong>Don’t undervalue your work forever.</strong> Low rates are okay to start, but your skills deserve proper compensation.</li>
            <li><strong>Focus on quality.</strong> Clients remember excellent work, and reviews are gold for freelancing growth.</li>
            <li><strong>Be consistent.</strong> Even a few hours per week can accumulate into a solid income if you plan projects wisely.</li>
            <li><strong>Build your profile carefully.</strong> Showcase past work, language skills, and professionalism.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>Freelancing taught me not only how to earn money on the side but also how to <strong>manage time, communicate professionally, and value my own skills</strong>. It’s a journey of growth as much as it is a source of income.</p>
        <p>If you’re a student like me, trying to make money while juggling classes and exams, starting as a freelancer is absolutely possible. The key is to start <strong>small, stay consistent, and build credibility</strong>. From my first $5 project to making $1,000 a month, every step was a learning opportunity—and one that can be repeated by anyone willing to put in the effort.</p>
