    "content": "Starting in the freelance world can seem overwhelming, but with strategy and consistency, it's very achievable. In my case, I began offering translations and proofreading in Hebrew, English, and Spanish. At first, I worked just a few hours per week while studying medicine, but I always maintained quality and professional communication with every client.\n\nWhat helped me take off was:\n\n1. **Choosing specific niches:** I focused on technical and medical translation, where competition is lower and rates are higher.\n2. **Building a solid profile:** on Upwork highlighting my experience, languages, and previous projects.\n3. **Gradually raising rates:** I started with small, lower-paying jobs, but after earning positive reviews, I increased my rate to $45/hour, aiming for higher-value projects.\n4. **Working per project, not per hour:** this allowed me to earn more with less time, reaching +$1000/month with only a few hours a week.\n\n**My advice:** start with what you know, choose a profitable niche, and build your reputation. Consistency and professionalism attract clients who value your time and expertise."
